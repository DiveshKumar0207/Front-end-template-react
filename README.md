## Styling

### Tailwind CSS

This project utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build designs directly in your markup.

### Material Tailwind

Additionally, the project incorporates [Material Tailwind](https://material-tailwind.com/), a Material Design component library built on top of Tailwind CSS. Material Tailwind provides ready-to-use components that follow the Material Design guidelines.

Feel free to explore the documentation of both [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) and [Material Tailwind](https://material-tailwind.com/docs) for more details on styling and available components.
